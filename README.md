# Chirper
## The 'Twiter' spinoff everyone needs!
### or I guess 'X' if you're up to date

## Introduction

As you can immagine Chirper is a Social Web Application that allows you to interact with others on the platform. We are creating this for our Web Development class for out 2nd project of the year. (You can find links to our first project 'task-timer' in our personal Githubs!!)

## How it's built

We are building Chirper on the Django Framwork. We don't like CSS so we are using Tailwind to make that job a little bit easier. Along the lines of making things easier we are using HTMX inorder to make the site have that modern streamline feel.
