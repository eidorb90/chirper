# Chirper
## The 'Twiter' spinoff everyone needs!
### (or I guess 'X' if you're up to date)

---
## Introduction

As you can imagine Chirper is a Social Web Application that allows you to interact with others on the platform. We are creating this for our Web Development class for our 2nd project of the year. (You can find links to our first project 'task-timer' in our personal Githubs!!)

---
## How it's built

We are building Chirper on the Django Framwork. Using Tailwind to make the styling job a little bit easier(because CSS isn't everyone's favorite!). Along the lines of making things easier we are using HTMX in order to make the site have that modern streamline feel.

## TODO extensions

2. ~~Allow users to follow each other~~
3. ~~make it look nice (we will be doing this along the way)  (Brodie)~~
4. ~~Allow rich text chirps (so allow people to do text formatting such as bold underline possibly add images and videos)~~
5. ~~Allow to toggle profile private~~
6. ~~Allow user to delete their account but not chirps~~

## TODO self

1. Fix the media pfp so that when a name is changed the old pic is deleted... if these isn't fixed before someone launched the app it would kill the storage of the server overtime.
